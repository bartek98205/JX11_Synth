# Synthesizer Project (JUCE + C++)

## Purpose of the Project
The primary purpose of this project is to explore and understand the fundamentals of synthesizer development, specifically focusing on sound generation, signal processing, and synthesis techniques. Through this project, I aim to:

- **Deepen my understanding of synthesizer basics**, including oscillators, filters, envelopes, and modulation.
- Learn and implement essential components of a synthesizer using **C++** and the **JUCE framework**.
- Create a functional audio plugin or standalone synthesizer application.

 ## Acknowledgments
- **Matthijs Hollemans** for his book _Creating Synthesizer Plug‚ÄêIns with C++ and JUCE_, which has served as the foundation for this project.
